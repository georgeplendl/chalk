# Chalk — Roadmap

## Status: v0 MVP shipped — polish in progress (v0.1.21)

The core loop works: install → draw on a page → someone else installs → visits the same URL → sees the drawing.

---

## Recently completed

- ✅ Toolbar redesigned to match Figma — horizontal, bottom-center, frosted glass, Lucide icons
- ✅ Chalk wordmark SVG logo in toolbar
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts: **P** (paintbrush), **T** (text), **Esc** (deactivate), **1–6** (colors)
- ✅ Escape deactivates tool and restores page scroll without closing the overlay
- ✅ Annotations fade in with stagger on load; fade out on close
- ✅ Toolbar animates in/out with spring easing
- ✅ Text annotation save-on-close bug fixed
- ✅ Swatch active state fixed (data-color comparison, box-shadow ring)

## Up Next

### API security (pre-launch blocker)
The Supabase anon key is embedded in the extension JS — anyone who unpacks the zip can hit the REST API directly and insert arbitrary annotations without the extension. Must be addressed before Chrome Web Store submission or any wide distribution.

Options (pick one):
- **Supabase Edge Function** — requests proxy through a serverless function that validates a secret header the extension sends; anon key stays server-side
- **Rate limiting** — cap inserts per session token per time window
- **Own backend API** — extension talks to our server, server holds the service role key

### Chrome Web Store submission
Move off manual zip sharing into real distribution. Biggest unlock for scale.

### Notification badge
Show annotation count when visiting a page that's already been chalked.
- Badge on toolbar icon on page load
- In-page toast: *"This page has been chalked — X annotations"*
- Count is already tracked in the extension, just needs wiring

### Report button UI
Backend schema and `reportAnnotation()` helper already exist — just needs a UI surface in the toolbar or on annotation objects.

### Eraser tool
Remove strokes from the canvas. Low-effort addition to the toolbar.

## Post-MVP

### Social layer
- Upvote / downvote on any annotation
- Threaded replies on text annotations
- Downvote-to-collapse (community self-moderation)
- Sort by: Top, New, Controversial

### Additional drawing tools
- Basic shapes (arrow, circle, rectangle)
- Opacity slider

### DOM-anchored annotations
Text annotations that anchor to specific DOM elements rather than raw pixel coordinates — survives minor page reflows.

### Identity & accounts
- Optional username + persistent identity, no real name required
- Karma score and annotation history
- Verified account badge with boosted sort ranking
- Badges for milestones

### Rich annotation types
- Stickers / stamps (meme templates, speech bubbles, reaction images)
- Voice messages (recorded audio, max 60s, CDN-hosted)
- Image uploads pinned to the page
- Highlight + annotate — select text on a page and attach a comment

### Discovery & feeds
- Trending pages — most annotated URLs right now
- Hot annotations — top-voted individual annotations across the web
- Following — follow users or specific URLs
- Collections — curate annotated pages into shareable lists

### Real-time collaboration
- See other users' cursors and drawing strokes live on the same page
- Presence indicators ("3 people annotating this page now")

### Layers & filters
- Toggle annotation types on/off (drawings only, text only, voice only)
- Filter by time range, vote threshold, user type
- NSFW layer — off by default, opt-in toggle, age-gated

### Per-page communities
- Appointed moderators for heavily-annotated pages
- Page "founders" (first to chalk a page) get founding moderator status

### Advanced moderation
- Shadowbanning — bad actors see their own annotations, others don't
- Site opt-out registry for domain owners who want to be excluded

### Distribution resilience
Full four-channel strategy once store risk becomes real:

| Channel | Censor resistance |
|---|---|
| Chrome Web Store | Low |
| Firefox Add-ons | Low |
| Direct sideload (.crx) | Medium |
| Userscript (Tampermonkey / Greasy Fork) | High |

The userscript is the censorship fallback — if stores pull the extension, users install the userscript and the product keeps running.

### Sticker pack marketplace
- Creators publish free or paid sticker packs
- Platform takes 30% of paid pack revenue

### Site owner API (B2B)
Businesses pay to embed a managed, branded version of Chalk on their own domain.

## Monetization (post-traction)

- **Cosmetic upgrades** — special brush effects, extended fonts, custom palettes (Discord Nitro model)
- **Spray Can credits** — soft currency for boosting annotations, pinning, gifting
- **Sticker pack marketplace** — 30% platform cut on paid packs
- **Site owner API** — white-label B2B licensing
- **Anonymized trend data** — aggregated annotation activity sold to media/researchers
