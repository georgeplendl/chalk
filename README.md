![Chalk — Draw on any webpage. See what others left behind.](Assets/chalk-graphic.png)

# Chalk

Chalk is a Chrome extension that layers a shared drawing canvas over any website. Leave freehand strokes, text, and color on top of any page — and see what others have left behind on the same URL.

## How it works

1. Install Chalk and visit any webpage
2. Click the Chalk icon in your toolbar to activate the overlay
3. Pick a color and brush size, then draw directly on the page
4. Close Chalk — your marks are saved
5. Anyone else with Chalk installed will see what you drew when they visit the same URL

## Features

**Drawing**
- Freehand brush with three sizes (Small, Medium, Large)
- Text tool — click anywhere on the page to place and type
- Multiple color swatches to choose from (black, red, green, blue, orange, white)
- More tools coming soon! (Shapes, Eraser, Arrows, Highlighting w/ Annotations, and more!)

**Keyboard shortcuts**
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `P` | Paintbrush |
| `T` | Text tool |
| `1` – `6` | Select color swatch |
| `Esc` | Deactivate current tool (restores page scroll) |

**Shared annotations**
- Everything saved by canonical URL — collaborative across all users
- Anonymous by default, no account required
